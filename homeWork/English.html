                Juin 15 is the day of hope for me, after the covid-19, after my 2 expÃ©riences of quarentines.

                2 days after we arrived at my parents, everthing was closed except for the supermarkets,  I had 2 weeks of absolute "family" time, and I started to really understand why the dogs need a walk every day.
                <br>
                <br>
                The freedom!

                I felt a bit more secure after I came back to France. But few weeks later, the nightmare came back when covid-19 exploded in mulhouse. That started my second experience of quarentine.
                <br>
                <br>
                 Life seemed less beautiful.

            <p>
                At the begining of the quarentine, I did my own masks like most people.      
            </p>

                Also, for once or twice I pranked him and he thought that he had a day of beauty. ðŸ˜‚ 
                <br>
                <br>
                Should always try to find the beauty of life.

                Luckily, I found my challange soon after, I started to fallow some online courses and learned about digitals. It is not easy, but at the same time it is quite interesting.
